    may be disclosed as follows:<br>
    By Law or to Protect Rights
</p>
<p>
    If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to<br>
    investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and<br>
    safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law,<br>
    rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection<br>
    and credit risk reduction.<br>

    general business analysis. We may also share your information with such third parties for<br>
    marketing purposes, as permitted by law.<br>
    Sale or Bankruptcy<br>

    entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity. If we go out of business or enter<br>
    bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a third party. You<br>

    communications from third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly.<br>
    THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES<br>
    The Application may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including<br>
    advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these<br>
    links to leave the Application, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by
</p>
<p>
    this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before<br>
    visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of<br>
    the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and<br>
    should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information.<br>
    We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third<br>
    parties, including other sites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the<br>
    Application.<br>
    SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION<br>
    We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal<br>
    information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you<br>
    provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or<br>
    impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or<br>
    other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse<br>
    by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide<br>
    personal information.<br>
    POLICY FOR CHILDREN<br>

    become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using<br>
    the contact information provided below.<br>
    CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES​<br>
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature<br>
    or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online<br>
    browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing<br>
    and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT<br>
    browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be<br>
    tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we<br>
    will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.<br>
